# Alembic Database Migrations

This directory contains database migrations for the ChainSync-Agents project.

## Usage

### Create a new migration

```bash
# Auto-generate migration based on model changes
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"

# Create empty migration file
alembic revision -m "Description of changes"
```

### Apply migrations

```bash
# Upgrade to latest version
alembic upgrade head

# Upgrade to specific revision
alembic upgrade <revision_id>

# Downgrade one version
alembic downgrade -1

# Downgrade to specific revision
alembic downgrade <revision_id>
```

### View migration history

```bash
# Show current revision
alembic current

# Show migration history
alembic history

# Show detailed history
alembic history --verbose
```

## Best Practices

1. Always review auto-generated migrations before applying
2. Test migrations on a copy of production data first
3. Include both upgrade and downgrade paths
4. Use descriptive migration messages
5. Don't edit migrations that have already been applied to production
