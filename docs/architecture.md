# ChainSync AI Agent Architecture

## Overview
ChainSync AI Agent is designed as a modular, extensible Python component for multi-domain enterprise platforms. It integrates with external APIs (OpenAI, ChainSync) and is intended for use as part of a larger system (e.g., MuleSoft integration).

## Components
- **Config Module (`chainsync/config.py`)**: Handles environment-based configuration and validation.
- **AI Agent (`chainsync/ai_agent.py`)**: (To be implemented) Core logic for AI-powered analysis and risk assessment.
- **Domain Manager (`chainsync/domain_manager.py`)**: (To be implemented) Manages domain-specific logic and coordination.
- **Main Application (`main.py`)**: Entry point, initializes configuration and agent, runs demo/test flows.

## Data Flow
1. **Startup**: `main.py` loads configuration and initializes the AI agent.
2. **Analysis**: The agent receives prompts and facility IDs, performs analysis using OpenAI and ChainSync APIs.
3. **Risk Assessment**: Facility data is fetched and risk is calculated.
4. **Integration**: Designed for integration with MuleSoft and other orchestration layers.

## Extensibility
- Add new domains by extending `domain_manager.py`.
- Add new analysis or risk models in `ai_agent.py`.
- Update configuration via environment variables or `.env` file.
